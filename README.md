# Main-Sequence Dippers Search Framework

A 2025 code demonstration looking for main-sequence dipper stars with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. 
This repository implements the methodology described in our paper for detecting and characterizing dipper stars—young stellar objects that exhibit dimming events in main-sequence stars. 

Paper describing the algorithm in more detail is now available on ApJ Open Access https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adf5bb
